# Evolutionary-Algorithm-in-Python

1. Problem Statemnent
We had to find a template image of a ”boothi” in the group image of different people. We have to develop an algorithm which should be generalized and can be implemented for all types ofthis problem. The most important thing about algorithm was that it shouldbe implemented on the basis of theory of natural selection and evolution by Charles Darwin.

2. This code has certain function:
- Create a population of irregular individuals
- Evaluate every individual’s fitness
- Select individuals to be parents
- Select individuals to be parents
- Produce children
